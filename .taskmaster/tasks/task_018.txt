# Task ID: 18
# Title: Commit Interactive Task Details Modal and Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Commit the completed implementation and tests for the Interactive Task Details Modal component to the local Git repository.
# Details:
Stage all changes related to the Interactive Task Details Modal component (Task 8) and its corresponding tests (Task 17). Write a clear and concise commit message summarizing the changes, following project conventions (e.g., "feat: Implement Task Details Modal" or "test: Add tests for Task Details Modal"). Execute the `git commit` command. Ensure all relevant files (modal component files, test files, potentially updated dependencies or configuration) are included in the commit.

# Test Strategy:
After committing, run `git status` to confirm the working directory is clean. Use `git log` to inspect the commit history and verify that the new commit exists, has the correct message, and includes the expected files. Review the diff of the commit using `git show <commit_hash>` to ensure only the intended changes are part of this commit.
