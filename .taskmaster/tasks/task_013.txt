# Task ID: 13
# Title: Test Kanban Board View Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive tests for the Kanban Board View component to ensure tasks are displayed correctly in their respective status columns with accurate details and styling.
# Details:
Write tests for the Kanban Board View component. Use mock data that includes tasks with different statuses (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled) and varying details (title length, dependency counts). Ensure the component correctly renders columns for each status. Verify that tasks are placed in the correct columns based on their status. Check that each task card displays the correct ID, title, priority, status, and dependency count. Confirm that the color coding for each task card accurately reflects its status as per the design specifications (e.g., green for completed, yellow for in progress). Consider using testing libraries like React Testing Library to simulate rendering and query elements.

# Test Strategy:
1. Prepare mock task data covering all four statuses and including tasks with dependencies. 2. Render the Kanban Board component using this mock data. 3. Use DOM queries to verify the presence of columns for 'Pending', 'In Progress', 'Completed', and 'Cancelled'. 4. For each task in the mock data, verify that its corresponding task card is rendered within the correct status column. 5. On each task card, assert that the displayed ID, title, priority, status text, and dependency count match the mock data. 6. Verify that the task card elements (or their containers) have the correct CSS classes or styles applied for status-based color coding. 7. Perform basic visual inspection in a browser to confirm layout and styling appear as expected.
