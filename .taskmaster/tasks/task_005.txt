# Task ID: 5
# Title: Frontend: Implement Data Processing and Metrics Calculation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the logic in the frontend to process the raw task data received from the backend, calculate metrics, and prepare data for different visualizations.
# Details:
Within the Redux slice or using selectors, implement functions to: 1. Calculate completion percentages (completed tasks / total tasks). 2. Group tasks by status for the Kanban view. 3. Calculate status distribution statistics. 4. Identify blocked tasks based on dependencies. 5. Prepare data structure suitable for dependency visualization (nodes and edges). Ensure data validation and error handling for unexpected data structures.

# Test Strategy:
Use mock task data with various statuses, dependencies, and structures. Verify that the data processing logic correctly calculates metrics, groups tasks, and identifies blocked tasks. Write unit tests for these data processing functions.
