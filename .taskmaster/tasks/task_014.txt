# Task ID: 14
# Title: Commit Kanban Board View and Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Commit the completed implementation and tests for the Kanban Board View to the local Git repository.
# Details:
Stage all changes related to the Kanban Board View component (Task 6) and its corresponding tests (Task 13). Write a clear and concise commit message summarizing the changes, following project conventions (e.g., "feat: Implement Kanban Board View" or "test: Add tests for Kanban Board"). Execute the `git commit` command. Ensure all relevant files (component files, test files, potentially updated dependencies or configuration) are included in the commit.

# Test Strategy:
After committing, run `git status` to confirm the working directory is clean. Use `git log` to inspect the commit history and verify that the new commit exists, has the correct message, and includes the expected files. Review the diff of the commit using `git show <commit_hash>` to ensure only the intended changes were included.
