# Title: Frontend: Implement Responsive Design and Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the entire dashboard application is fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes and optimize performance.
# Details:
Review all frontend components (Kanban, Dashboard, Modal, TaskCard) and apply responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS utility classes (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes). Test layouts on different screen sizes using browser developer tools or emulators. Implement performance optimizations mentioned in the PRD if necessary (e.g., virtual scrolling for large lists using libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized`, lazy loading components using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`). Optimize data fetching and state updates to ensure smooth real-time performance.

# Test Strategy:
Test the dashboard on various devices and screen resolutions. Verify that layouts adapt correctly, elements are accessible, and touch interactions work on mobile/tablet. Use browser performance tools (Lighthouse, Performance tab) to identify and fix performance bottlenecks. Test with a large tasks.json file (>1000 tasks) to check for performance degradation.
