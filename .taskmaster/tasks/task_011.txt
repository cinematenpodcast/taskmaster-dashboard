# Task ID: 11
# Title: Initialize Remote Repository and Push Project
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Initialize a new GitHub repository for the project, add it as a remote origin to the local Git repository, and push the entire project codebase to the remote.
# Details:
Create a new, empty repository on GitHub (or your preferred Git hosting service). Do NOT initialize it with a README or license file, as the local repository already exists. Once created, copy the remote URL. In the project's root directory, add the remote using `git remote add origin <remote_url>`. Verify the remote was added correctly using `git remote -v`. Finally, push the current state of the main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) to the remote using `git push -u origin main` (replace `main` with your branch name if different). Ensure all relevant files are staged and committed before pushing.

# Test Strategy:
After executing the commands, navigate to the GitHub repository in a web browser. Verify that all project files and directories (backend, frontend, root files like .gitignore) have been successfully pushed and are visible in the repository. Check that the commit history matches the local history.
