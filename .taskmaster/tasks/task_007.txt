# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the Dashboard Overview view component to display project metrics and statistics using cards and charts.
# Details:
Create a React component for the Dashboard overview. Use Tailwind CSS for a card-based layout. Display calculated metrics like completion percentage, task distribution by status, and priority distribution. Use a charting library like Chart.js (`npm install chart.js react-chartjs-2`) to visualize distributions (e.g., pie chart for status, bar chart for priority). Display key statistics in separate cards.

# Test Strategy:
Render the Dashboard view with mock data. Verify that calculated metrics are displayed correctly. Check that charts render and accurately represent the data distributions. Test responsiveness of the layout.
