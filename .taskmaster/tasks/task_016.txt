# Task ID: 16
# Title: Commit Dashboard Overview View and Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Commit the completed implementation and tests for the Dashboard Overview View to the local Git repository.
# Details:
Stage all changes related to the Dashboard Overview View component (Task 7) and its corresponding tests (Task 15). Write a clear and concise commit message summarizing the changes, following project conventions (e.g., "feat: Implement Dashboard Overview View" or "test: Add tests for Dashboard"). Execute the `git commit` command. Ensure all relevant files (component files, test files, potentially updated dependencies or configuration) are included in the commit.

# Test Strategy:
After committing, run `git status` to confirm the working directory is clean. Use `git log` to inspect the commit history and verify that the new commit exists, has the correct message, and includes the expected files. Review the diff of the commit using `git show <commit_hash>` to ensure only the intended changes are included.
