# Task ID: 19
# Title: Test Dependency Visualization Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive tests for the Dependency Visualization component to ensure it accurately displays task relationships and highlights blocked tasks.
# Details:
Write tests for the Dependency Visualization component using a testing library like React Testing Library or Jest. Prepare diverse mock task data sets covering various dependency structures, including linear chains, branching dependencies, tasks with no dependencies, and tasks with multiple dependencies. Ensure the tests verify that task nodes and dependency edges are rendered correctly with appropriate directional indicators. Test the logic and visual application of highlighting for tasks identified as blocked (having uncompleted dependencies). If the implementation includes interaction, such as clicking a node to open the Task Details Modal (Task 8), include tests to verify this functionality.

# Test Strategy:
1. Prepare mock task data representing different dependency graph structures. 2. Render the Dependency Visualization component with the mock data. 3. Use DOM queries or snapshot testing to verify the correct rendering of nodes and edges. 4. Assert that tasks with uncompleted dependencies are visually highlighted as expected. 5. If applicable, simulate clicking on a task node and verify that the Task Details Modal opens with the correct task information.
